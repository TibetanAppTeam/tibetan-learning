# tibetan-learning
Web application for Tibetan language learners

# Team members:
- **Paulina Binas** - aspiring Java developer currently working a part-time Front-End job. Obsessed with fantasy worlds, games and books, and doing some yoga in spare time. On the side note, also Tenzin's partner, which led to the interest in Tibetan language and culture.
- **Tenzin Choewang** - currently working as a front-end intern. There are not many application to learn Tibetan language and culture, so I got inspired to make a proper one which will help foreigners as well as Tibetan to practice and learn Tibetan. 
- more to come :smile:
